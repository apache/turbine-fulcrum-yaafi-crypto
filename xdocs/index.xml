    <section name="Overview">
      <p>
        Fulcrum Crypto Library is an extension library for Fulcrum YAAFI
        to support transparent decryption of configuration files.
      </p>  
    </section>

    <section name="Cryptography Support">

      <p>
        The YAAFI container supports decryption of configuration files using
        Sun's JCA (Java Crypto Architecture). The encryption/decryption is 
        based on DES using 56 bit key length.
      </p>

      <subsection name="JDK 1.3.x">
        <p>
          For JDK 1.3.x the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jce/index-122.html">
          Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) 1.2.2</a> needs to be installed.
          Furthermore you need to add the jce1_2_2.jar to your Maven repository
          and project.xml
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="JDK 1.4.x">
        <p>
          The current JDK's have the JCA built-in therefore no extra configuration
          is required.
